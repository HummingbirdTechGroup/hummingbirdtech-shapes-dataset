# ToyDatasets

Simple datasets made to speed-up the development of deep learning models using PyTorch. 

Training a model on common datasets such as the COCO dataset (for image segmentation) or Wikipedia (text modeling) is a long and tedious task because convergence may happen after GPU-days.
For image classification, one will often use the MNIST dataset to validate the implementation of a model. The toy datasets provided in the repo are simple tasks designed to validate the implementation of a model in other areas.
